## Install 
**Step 1: Git Clone & Install Python Packages**
```
git clone https://github.com/Super-Chain/N8N-Genie.git
cd N8N-Genie
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables**

We are using [Open DeepWiki API](https://github.com/AsyncFuncAI/deepwiki-open/tree/main/api) `/api` folder

Create a .env file in the project root:
```
# Required API Keys
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key        # Required for Google Gemini models
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key        # Required for embeddings and OpenAI models

# Optional API Keys
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key  # Required only if using OpenRouter models

# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://custom-api-endpoint.com/v1  # Optional, for custom OpenAI API endpoints

```

**Step 3: Start the API Server** 

Using bash 

`uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 1234`

Using Docker 
```
# Build the image (run this from the N8N-Genie directory)
docker build -t n8n-genie .

# Run the container (the .env file is now copied into the image)
docker run -d \
  --name n8n-genie-app \
  -p 1234:1234 \
  --env-file .env \
  n8n-genie
```

## N8N Installation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT WARNING**: Before proceeding with any installation method, **BACKUP YOUR EXISTING N8N DATA** to prevent any potential data loss during the plugin installation process. This includes workflows, credentials, and any custom configurations.

> üìã **Docker Volume Reminder**: If you're using Docker for n8n, ensure you have proper volume mounts configured to persist your data. Example: `-v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n` to maintain your workflows and settings across container restarts.

### Option 1: Fresh Installation (Local Host Fresh install)

Use this method if you're setting up n8n for the first time or want a clean installation with the N8N Genie plugin.

#### Build from n8n Repository

1. **Clone the official n8n repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n.git
   cd n8n
   ```

2. **Copy the N8N Genie plugin files**
   
   Copy the following files into the `docker/images/n8n` folder of the cloned n8n repo:
   - `plugin.js` - Main plugin frontend code
   - `apply_plugin.js` - Plugin injection script for the n8n interface
   
   ```bash
   cp ~/N8N-Genie/n8n-genie-js/plugin.js docker/images/n8n/
   cp ~/N8N-Genie/n8n-genie-js/apply_plugin.js docker/images/n8n/
   ```

3. **Modify the Dockerfile**
   
   Add the following lines to the `docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile` after the existing WORKDIR and COPY commands:

   Lookup the line `WORKDIR /home/node` and copy the following after this line
   
   ```dockerfile
    # Start with the official N8N image
    FROM docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:latest
    
    # Switch to root to modify files
    USER root
    
    # Copy your custom files
    COPY docker/images/n8n/plugin.js /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n/node_modules/n8n-editor-ui/dist/assets/plugin.js
    COPY docker/images/n8n/apply_plugin.js /home/node/apply_plugin.js
    
    # Run your plugin script
    WORKDIR /home/node
    RUN node apply_plugin.js
    
    # Change port to 5678 (optional)
    ENV N8N_PORT=5679=8
    EXPOSE 5678
    
    # Switch back to node user
    USER node
    
    # Use the same entrypoint as the official image
    ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--", "/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
   ```
4. **Build Custom N8N image**
  ```bash
  docker build -t sc-n8n-custom .
  ```

5. **Run the enhanced n8n instance**
   ```bash
   docker volume create n8n_genie_data
   docker run -d --name sc-n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_genie_data:/home/node/.n8n sc-n8n-custom

   ```

### Option 2: Existing N8N Instance Modification

Use this method if you already have a running n8n instance and want to add the N8N Genie plugin functionality.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: This modification involves changes to your existing n8n installation. **BACKUP ALL YOUR DATA** before proceeding. Stop your current n8n instance and export all workflows as a precautionary measure.

#### For Docker-based Existing Installations

1. **Stop your current n8n container**
   ```bash
   docker stop your-n8n-container-name
   ```

2. **Backup your n8n data**
   ```bash
   # If using volume mounts
   cp -r ~/.n8n ~/.n8n-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   
   # If using named volumes, backup with:
   docker run --rm -v your-n8n-volume:/source -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar czf /backup/n8n-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C /source .
   ```

3. **Identify your current n8n container image and version**
   ```bash
   docker inspect your-n8n-container-name | grep Image
   ```

4. **Create a new Dockerfile for modification**
   ```dockerfile
   # Use your existing n8n image as base
   FROM n8nio/n8n:latest  # Replace with your current version
   
   USER root
   
   # Copy the N8N Genie plugin files
   COPY plugin.js /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n/node_modules/n8n-editor-ui/dist/assets/
   COPY apply_plugin.js /tmp/
   
   # Apply the plugin modifications
   RUN cd /tmp && node apply_plugin.js
   
   USER node
   ```

5. **Build the modified image**
   ```bash
   # Copy plugin files to current directory first
   cp ~/N8N-Genie/n8n-genie-js/plugin.js .
   cp ~/N8N-Genie/n8n-genie-js/apply_plugin.js .
   ```

6. **Run the modified n8n instance with data persistence**
   ```bash
   # Using volume mount (recommended)
   docker run -d --name sc-n8n \
     -p 5678:5678 \
     -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
     docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
   ```
### Verification and Rollback

After installation, verify the plugin is working correctly:

1. **Access your n8n interface** at `http://localhost:5678`
2. **Look for the N8N Genie panel** in the sidebar
3. **Test basic functionality** by trying to create a simple workflow

**If something goes wrong:**
```bash
# For Docker installations
docker stop sc-n8n
docker run -d --name n8n-original -p 5678:5678 -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n n8nio/n8n:latest
```
